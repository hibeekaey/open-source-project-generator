# Specification Documentation Guide

This guide provides comprehensive directions for creating requirements, design, and task documents from input specifications for the Open Source Template Generator project.

## Overview

The specification process follows a three-phase approach to transform high-level feature ideas into actionable implementation plans:

1. **Requirements Phase**: Define what needs to be built with clear acceptance criteria
2. **Design Phase**: Architect how the solution will be implemented
3. **Tasks Phase**: Break down the work into concrete, trackable implementation steps

## Document Structure

### Directory Organization

```
.cursor/specs/
├── {feature-name}/
│   ├── requirements.md    # What needs to be built
│   ├── design.md         # How it will be built
│   └── tasks.md          # Step-by-step implementation plan
└── README.md             # This guide
```

### Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for feature directories (e.g., `project-cleanup`, `test-system-consolidation`)
- Feature names should be descriptive and focused on the primary goal
- Keep names concise but clear (2-4 words maximum)

## Phase 1: Requirements Document

### Purpose

Define WHAT needs to be built with clear, testable acceptance criteria that serve as a contract between stakeholders and implementers.

### Template Structure

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
Brief overview of the feature and its purpose in 2-3 sentences.

## Requirements

### Requirement N: [Requirement Name]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want to [action/goal], so that [benefit/value].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [expected behavior]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [expected behavior]
3. IF [conditional situation] THEN [expected handling]
4. WHEN [final condition] THEN [completion criteria]
```

### Writing Guidelines

#### User Stories

- **Format**: "As a [role], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]"
- **Focus**: Keep user-centric and value-driven
- **Scope**: One clear goal per user story
- **Examples**:
  - "As a developer maintaining this project, I want to remove unnecessary commands, so that the project focuses only on core functionality"
  - "As a developer running tests, I want unified test execution, so that I don't need different commands for different environments"

#### Acceptance Criteria

- **Structure**: Use "WHEN/THEN/IF" format for clarity
- **Specificity**: Be precise about expected behavior
- **Testability**: Each criterion should be verifiable
- **Completeness**: Cover normal, edge, and error cases
- **Language**: Use "SHALL" for mandatory requirements

#### Requirements Organization

- **Logical Grouping**: Group related functionality together
- **Numbering**: Use sequential numbering (Requirement 1, 2, 3...)
- **Dependencies**: Note dependencies between requirements
- **Scope**: Each requirement should be focused and cohesive

3. **Understand Context**: Review related code and existing patterns
4. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Ask questions about unclear requirements

### Step 2: Requirements Extraction

1. **Identify Users**: Who will benefit from this feature?
2. **Define Goals**: What are the user's objectives?
3. **List Behaviors**: What should the system do?
4. **Define Acceptance**: How will we know it's complete?

### Step 3: Design Planning

1. **Analyze Current State**: Understand existing architecture
2. **Design Target State**: Plan the desired end state
3. **Plan Migration**: Define the path from current to target
4. **Consider Constraints**: Account for technical and business constraints

### Step 4: Task Breakdown

- **Optimization Strategy**: Plan specific improvements
- **Performance Validation**: Measure improvements

## Tools and Automation

### Document Generation

- Use consistent templates for each document type
- Consider automation for repetitive sections
- Validate document structure and formatting

### Requirements Traceability

- Link tasks back to specific requirements
- Use consistent requirement numbering
- Track requirements coverage in tasks

### Progress Tracking

- Use markdown checkboxes for task completion
- Update status regularly during implementation
- Generate progress reports from task completion

## Examples

See existing specifications for reference:

- **[Project Cleanup](project-cleanup/)**: Example of a removal/cleanup feature
- **[Test System Consolidation](test-system-consolidation/)**: Example of a system unification feature

These examples demonstrate the complete specification process from initial input to detailed implementation tasks.

## Conclusion

Following this structured approach ensures that feature development is well-planned, requirements are clearly defined, and implementation is systematic and trackable. The three-phase process provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining traceability from user needs to implementation details.

The key to success is being thorough in each phase while maintaining focus on user value and technical feasibility. Each document should stand alone while contributing to a cohesive implementation plan.
