# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The golangci-lint analysis revealed multiple categories of code quality issues that need to be addressed to improve maintainability, reliability, and adherence to Go best practices. This feature focuses on systematically fixing all identified linting issues to achieve a clean codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Code Quality Issues

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this project, I want critical code quality issues resolved, so that the codebase is reliable and follows Go best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN there SHALL be no duplicate code violations (dupl)
2. WHEN functions return errors THEN the system SHALL check all error return values (errcheck)
3. WHEN code is committed THEN all files SHALL be properly formatted (gofmt)
4. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN there SHALL be no critical staticcheck violations

### Requirement 2: Improve Code Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer reading and modifying this code, I want functions with reasonable complexity and clear variable scoping, so that the code is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing function complexity THEN no function SHALL have cyclomatic complexity > 15 (gocyclo)
2. WHEN variables are declared THEN they SHALL not shadow outer scope variables inappropriately (govet)
3. WHEN string literals are repeated THEN they SHALL be extracted as named constants (goconst)
4. WHEN assignments are made THEN they SHALL have an effect on program behavior (ineffassign)

### Requirement 3: Fix Language and API Usage Issues

**User Story:** As a developer using this codebase, I want correct spelling and modern API usage, so that the code is professional and uses current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text contains spelling errors THEN they SHALL be corrected (misspell)
2. WHEN using deprecated APIs THEN they SHALL be replaced with current alternatives (staticcheck)
3. WHEN using built-in types as keys THEN custom types SHALL be used to avoid collisions (staticcheck)
4. WHEN memory allocations can be avoided THEN pointer-like arguments SHALL be used (staticcheck)

### Requirement 4: Achieve Clean Linting Status

**User Story:** As a developer running CI/CD pipelines, I want golangci-lint to pass without errors, so that code quality checks don't block deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN golangci-lint runs on the entire codebase THEN it SHALL exit with status code 0
2. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN there SHALL be no errors reported
3. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN there SHALL be no warnings reported
4. WHEN new code is added THEN it SHALL maintain the clean linting status

### Requirement 5: Maintain Functional Correctness

**User Story:** As a user of this template generator, I want all functionality to work exactly as before, so that fixing code quality issues doesn't break existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN linting fixes are applied THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
2. WHEN code is refactored THEN the external API SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN complexity is reduced THEN the business logic SHALL remain identical
4. WHEN constants are extracted THEN the runtime behavior SHALL be preserved
