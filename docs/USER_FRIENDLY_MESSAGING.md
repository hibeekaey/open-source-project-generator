# User-Friendly Messaging Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to user-facing messages, errors, and outputs throughout the Open Source Project Generator to make them more helpful, clear, and actionable.

## Key Principles Applied

### 1. **Clear and Specific Language**

- Replaced technical jargon with plain English
- Made error messages specific about what went wrong
- Provided context about why something failed

### 2. **Actionable Guidance**

- Added suggestions for how to fix issues
- Included relevant commands users can run
- Pointed users to helpful resources

### 3. **Visual Hierarchy with Colors**

- Used colors to highlight important information
- Applied consistent color coding across all messages
- Made errors, warnings, and success states visually distinct

### 4. **Consistent Tone**

- Maintained a helpful, supportive tone
- Avoided blame language ("you did wrong" → "this needs attention")
- Used encouraging language for success states

## Specific Improvements Made

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

#### **Flag Conflicts**

**Before:**

```
🚫 You can't use both --verbose and --quiet at the same time
```

**After:**

```
🚫 --verbose and --quiet flags can't be used together - choose one or the other
```

#### **Invalid Options**

**Before:**

```
🚫 'invalid' isn't a valid log level. Try one of these: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
```

**After:**

```
🚫 'invalid' isn't a valid log level. Available options: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
```

#### **Input Errors**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Couldn't read the project name: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Unable to read project name. Please try typing it again or check your input
```

### Validation Messages

#### **Validation Failures**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Your configuration has some issues: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Configuration validation failed. Please check your settings and try again
```

#### **Project Validation**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Couldn't validate your project: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Project validation encountered an issue. Try running with --verbose to see more details
```

#### **Issue Reporting**

**Before:**

```
❌ Found some issues that need attention
📊 Issues: 5
⚠️  Warnings: 3
```

**After:**

```
❌ Found some issues that need attention. See details below
📊 Issues: 5 (highlighted in red)
⚠️  Warnings: 3 (highlighted in yellow)
```

### Configuration Management

#### **Configuration Not Found**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Can't find configuration 'my-config'
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Configuration 'my-config' doesn't exist. Use 'generator config list' to see available configurations
```

#### **Access Issues**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Couldn't find your configurations: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Unable to access your saved configurations. Check if the configuration directory exists and is readable
```

#### **Deletion Confirmation**

**Before:**

```
❌ Deletion cancelled
```

**After:**

```
❌ Deletion cancelled. Your configuration is safe
```

### Validation Engine

#### **Structure Validation**

**Before:**

```
🚫 couldn't validate project structure: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Unable to validate project structure. Check if your project follows the expected directory layout
```

#### **Dependency Validation**

**Before:**

```
🚫 Couldn't validate project dependencies: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Dependency validation failed. Check your package.json, go.mod, or other dependency files
```

#### **File Access Issues**

**Before:**

```
🚫 couldn't read package.json file: <technical error>
```

**After:**

```
🚫 Unable to read package.json file. Check if the file exists and has proper permissions
```
