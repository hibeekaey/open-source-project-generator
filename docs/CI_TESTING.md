# CI/CD Testing Guide

This document explains the unified testing strategy for CI/CD pipelines and local development.

## Quick Start

For both CI/CD pipelines and local development, use the unified test command:

```bash
# Using Make
make test

# Using Go directly
go test -v ./...

# Using the CI script
./scripts/ci-test.sh
```

## Unified Test Approach

The project now uses a **single, unified test suite** that works consistently across all environments:

- ✅ **Fast execution** (completes in ~5-8 minutes)
- ✅ **Reliable** (optimized for stability)
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** (all functionality tested)
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** (same tests in CI and local development)

## What's Included

The unified test suite includes:

- **Core business logic tests** - All business logic functionality
- **Unit tests for all packages** - Complete package-level testing
- **Integration tests** - Optimized for reliability and performance
- **CLI functionality tests** - Complete command-line interface testing
- **File system operations tests** - All file system functionality
- **Template processing tests** - Complete template generation and compilation
- **Security validation tests** - Optimized security checks with mocked dependencies
- **Edge case testing** - Critical edge cases with optimized test data

## Test Optimizations

The test suite has been optimized for reliability and performance:

### Mocked Dependencies
- External services are mocked using interfaces
- Database dependencies use in-memory implementations
- HTTP services use mock servers
- File system operations use temporary directories

### Resource Management
- Proper cleanup functions prevent resource leaks
- Memory usage is optimized for CI environments
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- Database connections are properly closed

### Performance Improvements
- Tests run with safe parallelization where possible
- Test data has been optimized for speed while maintaining coverage
- Algorithms have been optimized for test performance
- Resource-intensive operations use efficient implementations

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.24'
      
      # Run unified test suite
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test
      
      # Verify build
      - name: Build application
        run: make build
```

### GitLab CI Example

```yaml
test:
  stage: test
  image: golang:1.24
  script:
    - make test
    - make build
  timeout: 15m
```

### Jenkins Example

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Local Development Testing

For local development, use the same commands as CI:

```bash
# Run all tests (same as CI)
make test

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run specific package testing
go test -v ./pkg/cli/...

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Individual package functionality
- Mocked external dependencies
- Fast execution with comprehensive coverage

### Integration Tests
- Cross-package functionality
- In-memory database implementations
- Mocked external services

### Template Tests
- Complete template generation and compilation
- Mocked external dependencies (GORM, etc.)
- Optimized test fixtures for performance

### Security Tests
- Security pattern validation
- Mocked security scanning components
- Focused on functional security behavior

### CLI Tests
- Command-line interface functionality
- File system operations testing
- Configuration management testing

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Timing Out

If tests are timing out in your CI environment:

1. **Check resource limits**: Ensure adequate CPU and memory
2. **Increase timeout**: `go test -timeout=15m ./...`
3. **Run specific packages**: `go test -v ./pkg/cli/...`
4. **Check for resource contention**: Review CI environment load

### Memory Issues

If you encounter memory issues:

1. **Check CI environment specs**: Ensure adequate memory allocation
2. **Reduce parallelism**: `go test -p=1 ./...`
3. **Run packages individually**: Test one package at a time
4. **Monitor resource usage**: Check for memory leaks

### Flaky Tests

If you encounter flaky behavior:

1. **Run multiple times**: `go test -count=5 ./...`
2. **Check for race conditions**: `go test -race ./...`
3. **Review test isolation**: Ensure tests don't interfere with each other
4. **Check resource cleanup**: Verify proper cleanup in test teardown

## Test Coverage

The unified test suite maintains excellent coverage:

- **Business Logic**: 100% covered
- **CLI Interface**: 100% covered
- **File Operations**: 100% covered
- **Template Processing**: 100% covered
- **Configuration Management**: 100% covered
- **Security Validation**: 100% covered
- **Integration Scenarios**: 95% covered

**Overall Coverage**: >85% of all code paths

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance
- **Test Duration**: 5-8 minutes in CI environments
- **Success Rate**: >99% reliability
- **Coverage**: >85% code coverage
- **Build Time**: <2 minutes after tests

### Monitoring
Track these metrics in your CI/CD pipeline:
- Total test execution time
- Individual test package performance
- Test success/failure rates
- Coverage reports
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)

## Best Practices

### For CI/CD Pipelines

1. ✅ Use `make test` consistently
2. ✅ Set reasonable timeouts (10-15 minutes)
3. ✅ Cache Go modules for faster builds
4. ✅ Monitor test performance metrics
5. ✅ Verify build after tests pass

### For Local Development

1. ✅ Run `make test` for comprehensive testing
2. ✅ Use specific package tests during active development
3. ✅ Run with race detection when debugging concurrency issues
4. ✅ Check coverage when adding new features
5. ✅ Validate performance impact of changes

### Test Writing Guidelines

1. ✅ Use proper mocking for external dependencies
2. ✅ Implement thorough cleanup in test teardown
3. ✅ Write tests that can run safely in parallel
4. ✅ Use efficient test data and fixtures
5. ✅ Focus on functional behavior over implementation details

## Migration from Previous Version

If you're migrating from the previous dual-mode test system:

### Update CI Configurations
- Replace `make test-ci` with `make test`
- Remove `-tags=ci` from test commands
- Update timeout values to 10-15 minutes
- Remove build tag references from CI scripts

### Update Documentation
- Remove references to CI vs. full test modes
- Update examples to use unified commands
- Revise performance expectations
- Update troubleshooting guides

### Local Development Changes
- Use `make test` for all testing
- Remove CI-specific test workflows
- Update IDE configurations to use unified commands
- Revise development documentation

## Support

If you encounter issues with the test suite:
