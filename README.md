## Architecture

The generator follows a clean architecture pattern with dependency injection and comprehensive validation:

- **CLI Interface**: Handles user interaction and command processing with comprehensive help
- **Template Engine**: Processes templates with variable substitution and conditional rendering
- **Configuration Manager**: Manages project configuration, validation, and defaults
- **File System Generator**: Creates directory structures and files with proper permissions
- **Version Manager**: Fetches latest package versions from registries (npm, Go modules, etc.)
- **Validation Engine**: Validates generated project structures and dependencies
- **Audit System**: Comprehensive codebase auditing and cleanup capabilities
- **Security Scanner**: Built-in security vulnerability detection and best practices enforcement

## Template Development

### Template Maintenance

For developers working with template files, comprehensive guidelines are available:

- **[Template Maintenance Guidelines](docs/TEMPLATE_MAINTENANCE.md)** - Complete guide for maintaining Go template files
- **[Quick Reference](docs/TEMPLATE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Essential commands and patterns for daily development

Key points for template development:

- All template files must have proper import statements for used packages
- Follow Go import organization conventions (standard library, third-party, local)
- Use validation tools before committing template changes
- Test template compilation with sample data

```bash
# Validate templates before committing
go run scripts/validate-templates/main.go --check-imports

# Generate test project to verify templates
go run cmd/generator/main.go --config config/test-configs/test-config.yaml --output test-validation
```
