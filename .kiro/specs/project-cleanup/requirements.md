# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on streamlining the Open Source Template Generator Go project by removing unnecessary commands and components, keeping only the core generator functionality. The cleanup will remove all command folders except the generator, and clean up configs, docs, internals, pkg, and scripts that are not essential to the base generator function.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Command Directory Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this project, I want to remove all unnecessary command implementations except the core generator, so that the project focuses only on its primary template generation functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the cmd directory THEN the system SHALL remove all command folders except cmd/generator
2. WHEN removing command folders THEN the system SHALL ensure no other parts of the codebase depend on the removed commands
3. WHEN cleaning up commands THEN the system SHALL preserve the main generator functionality completely
4. WHEN removing unused commands THEN the system SHALL update any documentation that references the removed commands
5. IF build scripts reference removed commands THEN they SHALL be updated to remove those references
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only the generator command SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 2: Internal Package Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want to remove internal packages that are not essential to the core generator functionality, so that the project has a cleaner and more focused structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining internal packages THEN the system SHALL identify which packages are essential for generator functionality
2. WHEN removing internal packages THEN the system SHALL ensure the generator functionality remains intact
3. WHEN cleaning up internals THEN the system SHALL remove packages related to removed commands
4. WHEN updating internal structure THEN the system SHALL maintain proper Go package organization
5. IF internal packages have dependencies THEN those dependencies SHALL be evaluated for removal
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only generator-essential internal packages SHALL remain

### Requirement 3: Package Directory Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer navigating the pkg directory, I want to remove packages that are not necessary for the core generator functionality, so that the codebase is focused and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining pkg packages THEN the system SHALL identify which packages are essential for template generation
2. WHEN removing pkg packages THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes to generator functionality
3. WHEN cleaning up packages THEN the system SHALL remove packages related to removed commands and features
4. WHEN updating package structure THEN the system SHALL maintain proper import relationships
5. IF packages have cross-dependencies THEN those relationships SHALL be evaluated and cleaned up
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only generator-essential packages SHALL remain in pkg directory

### Requirement 4: Configuration Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer working with project configuration, I want to remove configuration files that are not necessary for the core generator functionality, so that the project configuration is simplified and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining config directory THEN the system SHALL identify which configurations are essential for generator functionality
2. WHEN removing config files THEN the system SHALL ensure generator functionality is not impacted
3. WHEN cleaning up configurations THEN the system SHALL remove configs related to removed commands and features
4. WHEN updating configurations THEN the system SHALL maintain proper configuration structure for remaining functionality
5. IF configuration files have dependencies THEN those dependencies SHALL be evaluated for removal
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only generator-essential configuration files SHALL remain

### Requirement 5: Documentation Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer reading project documentation, I want documentation to reflect only the core generator functionality, so that the documentation is accurate and not confusing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining docs directory THEN the system SHALL identify which documentation is relevant to generator functionality
2. WHEN removing documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure essential generator documentation is preserved
3. WHEN cleaning up docs THEN the system SHALL remove documentation related to removed commands and features
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy of remaining documentation
5. IF documentation references removed features THEN those references SHALL be removed or updated
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only generator-relevant documentation SHALL remain

### Requirement 6: Scripts Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer working with project scripts, I want to remove scripts that are not necessary for the core generator functionality, so that the project tooling is simplified and focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining scripts directory THEN the system SHALL identify which scripts are essential for generator functionality
2. WHEN removing scripts THEN the system SHALL ensure generator build and development workflows remain functional
3. WHEN cleaning up scripts THEN the system SHALL remove scripts related to removed commands and features
4. WHEN updating scripts THEN the system SHALL maintain proper build and development tooling for generator
5. IF scripts have dependencies on removed components THEN those scripts SHALL be removed or updated
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only generator-essential scripts SHALL remain

### Requirement 7: Dependency and Import Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer managing project dependencies, I want to remove dependencies that are no longer needed after removing non-essential components, so that the project has minimal dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining go.mod THEN the system SHALL identify dependencies that are no longer needed after component removal
2. WHEN removing dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure generator functionality is not impacted
3. WHEN cleaning up imports THEN the system SHALL remove unused imports from remaining files
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL run go mod tidy to clean up module file
5. IF dependencies are shared between removed and remaining components THEN usage SHALL be carefully evaluated
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN only dependencies required for generator functionality SHALL remain

### Requirement 8: Build and Test Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer building and testing the project, I want build configurations and tests to be updated to reflect the simplified project structure, so that the build process is clean and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining build configurations THEN the system SHALL update them to reflect removed components
2. WHEN removing components THEN the system SHALL ensure related tests are also removed or updated
3. WHEN cleaning up tests THEN the system SHALL ensure generator functionality tests remain intact
4. WHEN updating build process THEN the system SHALL ensure generator can still be built and run correctly
5. IF CI/CD configurations exist THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect the simplified project structure
6. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN build and test processes SHALL work correctly for the generator-only project
