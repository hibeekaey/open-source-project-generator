#### Essential Infrastructure
- `templates/` - All template files for project generation
- `config/` - Configuration files for template generation
- `scripts/` - Build and validation scripts
- `docs/` - Essential documentation
- Build system (Makefile, Docker configurations)

## Recommendations for Future Development

### 1. **Maintain Focus**
- Keep the project focused on template generation
- Resist adding auxiliary tools that don't directly support this goal
- Consider separate repositories for unrelated tooling

### 2. **Template Expansion**
- Add new templates for emerging technologies
- Improve existing templates based on user feedback
- Keep templates up to date with latest package versions

### 3. **Core Improvements**
- Enhance the template engine capabilities
- Improve error handling and user experience
- Add more validation for generated projects

### 4. **Documentation**
- Keep documentation focused on template generation
- Provide clear examples and use cases
- Maintain template development guidelines

## Conclusion

The cleanup process successfully transformed the project from a complex multi-purpose tool into a focused, efficient template generator. The reduction in complexity while maintaining all core functionality represents a significant improvement in project maintainability and developer experience.

The generator now provides a clean, single-purpose interface for creating production-ready project structures, making it easier for users to understand and use, and for developers to maintain and extend.
