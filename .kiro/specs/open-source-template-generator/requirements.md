# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive open source project template generator that creates production-ready, enterprise-grade project structures following modern best practices. The generator will create a complete multi-service architecture with frontend applications, backend services, mobile applications, infrastructure code, and comprehensive documentation, all configured with the latest package versions and security best practices.

5. WHEN creating frontend structure THEN the system SHALL include proper component organization with ui/, hooks/, context/, and API/ directories

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated backend service to use modern Go patterns, so that I have a scalable and maintainable API server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating backend THEN the system SHALL create a Go 1.22+ project with proper module structure
2. WHEN creating backend THEN the system SHALL include Gin framework, GORM, JWT authentication, and Redis integration

2. WHEN creating mobile apps THEN the system SHALL create iOS project with Swift 5.9+, SwiftUI, and proper architecture
3. WHEN setting up mobile THEN the system SHALL include proper dependency management (Gradle for Android, CocoaPods for iOS)
4. WHEN generating mobile THEN the system SHALL create shared resources directory with common assets and API specifications
5. WHEN creating mobile structure THEN the system SHALL include proper testing setup and build configurations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive CI/CD and security configurations, so that my project follows DevOps and security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating project THEN the system SHALL create GitHub Actions workflows for CI, security scanning, and deployment
2. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN the system SHALL include Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
3. WHEN creating security setup THEN the system SHALL include CodeQL analysis, vulnerability scanning, and security policies
4. WHEN generating workflows THEN the system SHALL create separate workflows for frontend, backend, and mobile testing
5. WHEN setting up security THEN the system SHALL include proper secret management and branch protection configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want infrastructure as code templates, so that I can deploy my application to production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create Terraform configurations for multi-environment deployment
2. WHEN setting up deployment THEN the system SHALL include Kubernetes manifests with proper resource limits and health checks
3. WHEN creating infrastructure THEN the system SHALL include Helm charts for package management
4. WHEN generating deployment THEN the system SHALL create Docker Compose files for local development and production
5. WHEN setting up infrastructure THEN the system SHALL include monitoring, logging, and observability configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation templates, so that my project has professional open source governance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating documentation THEN the system SHALL create README.md with proper project description, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. WHEN creating governance THEN the system SHALL include CONTRIBUTING.md with detailed contribution guidelines and standards
3. WHEN setting up documentation THEN the system SHALL create SECURITY.md with vulnerability reporting procedures
4. WHEN generating docs THEN the system SHALL include API documentation templates and user guides
