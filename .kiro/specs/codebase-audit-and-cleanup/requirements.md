# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves performing a comprehensive audit and cleanup of the entire open-source template generator codebase to ensure it follows best practices, removes redundant code, properly organizes files and folders, ensures all tests pass, and updates templates to use the latest versions of libraries, tools, and dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the codebase to be properly organized and follow Go project conventions, so that new contributors can easily understand the project structure and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL verify all Go packages are in appropriate directories following Go conventions
2. WHEN examining file organization THEN the system SHALL ensure test files are co-located with their corresponding source files
3. WHEN reviewing folder structure THEN the system SHALL confirm that internal packages are properly separated from public APIs
4. WHEN checking imports THEN the system SHALL verify no circular dependencies exist
5. WHEN validating naming THEN the system SHALL ensure all files and directories follow Go naming conventions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused and redundant code removed from the codebase, so that the project remains maintainable and doesn't accumulate technical debt.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for unused code THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused functions, variables, and imports
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove unused external dependencies from go.mod
3. WHEN reviewing templates THEN the system SHALL remove any duplicate or redundant template files
4. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL eliminate unused configuration options
5. WHEN examining test files THEN the system SHALL remove obsolete or redundant test cases

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want all tests to pass and be properly organized, so that the codebase maintains high quality and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all unit tests SHALL pass without errors
2. WHEN executing integration tests THEN all integration tests SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN checking test coverage THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve current coverage levels
4. WHEN validating test organization THEN test files SHALL be properly named with _test.go suffix
5. WHEN reviewing test structure THEN tests SHALL follow Go testing best practices and conventions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a template user, I want all templates to use the latest stable versions of libraries, tools, and dependencies, so that generated projects are secure and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Go templates THEN the system SHALL update to Go 1.22+ and latest stable dependencies
2. WHEN reviewing Node.js templates THEN the system SHALL update to Node.js 20+ and latest npm packages
3. WHEN checking frontend templates THEN the system SHALL update to Next.js 15+ and latest React ecosystem packages
4. WHEN examining mobile templates THEN the system SHALL update to Kotlin 2.0+ and Swift 5.9+ with latest frameworks
5. WHEN validating infrastructure templates THEN the system SHALL update to Docker 24+, Kubernetes 1.28+, and Terraform 1.6+
6. WHEN checking security dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure no known vulnerabilities exist in any dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the codebase to follow security best practices and have no vulnerabilities, so that the generated projects are secure by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for security issues THEN the system SHALL identify and fix any security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN reviewing template security THEN generated projects SHALL include security best practices
3. WHEN checking dependencies THEN all dependencies SHALL be free of known security vulnerabilities
4. WHEN validating configurations THEN security configurations SHALL be properly implemented
5. WHEN examining secrets handling THEN no hardcoded secrets or sensitive data SHALL exist in the codebase

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system and CI/CD pipelines to work correctly, so that the project can be built, tested, and deployed reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running make commands THEN all Makefile targets SHALL execute successfully
2. WHEN building the project THEN the build process SHALL complete without errors for all supported platforms
3. WHEN checking CI configuration THEN GitHub Actions workflows SHALL be valid and functional
4. WHEN validating Docker setup THEN all Dockerfiles SHALL build successfully and follow best practices
5. WHEN testing deployment scripts THEN all deployment automation SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, so that I can understand how to use and contribute to the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing README files THEN documentation SHALL be accurate and reflect current functionality
2. WHEN checking code comments THEN all public APIs SHALL have proper Go documentation comments
3. WHEN validating examples THEN all code examples in documentation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN examining CLI help THEN command-line help text SHALL be comprehensive and accurate
5. WHEN reviewing contribution guidelines THEN documentation SHALL provide clear guidance for contributors
