# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to maintain up-to-date versions across all project templates and establish consistency in frontend template configurations. The system should automatically update template versions, standardize configurations for Vercel deployment, and provide a strategy for ongoing maintenance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a template maintainer, I want all templates to use the latest stable versions of their respective technologies, so that generated projects start with current and secure dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is generated THEN the system SHALL use the current versions specified in versions.md
2. WHEN versions.md is updated THEN all relevant template files SHALL be automatically updated to reflect new versions
3. IF a template uses Java THEN it SHALL use version 17.0.0
4. IF a template uses Node.js THEN it SHALL use version 22.19.0
5. IF a template uses Go THEN it SHALL use version 1.25.1
6. IF a template uses Next.js THEN it SHALL use version 15.5.2
7. IF a template uses React THEN it SHALL use version 19.1.0
8. IF a template uses Kotlin THEN it SHALL use version 2.2.10
9. IF a template uses Swift THEN it SHALL use version 6.1.3

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend templates to have consistent base configurations, so that projects can be deployed to Vercel and run locally without configuration conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any frontend template THEN it SHALL include standardized Vercel deployment configuration
2. WHEN generating any frontend template THEN it SHALL include consistent local development setup
3. WHEN generating Next.js templates THEN they SHALL use identical base configurations for routing, build settings, and deployment
4. WHEN generating React templates THEN they SHALL use consistent package.json scripts and build configurations
5. IF a frontend template includes TypeScript THEN it SHALL use standardized tsconfig.json settings
6. IF a frontend template includes ESLint THEN it SHALL use consistent linting rules across all templates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a template maintainer, I want an automated system to check for version updates, so that templates stay current without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs version checks THEN it SHALL query official registries for latest stable versions
2. WHEN new versions are detected THEN the system SHALL update versions.md automatically
3. WHEN versions.md is updated THEN the system SHALL propagate changes to all affected template files
4. IF version updates are available THEN the system SHALL create a report of changes made
5. WHEN version updates fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and maintain previous versions
6. IF breaking changes are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them for manual review

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want template validation to ensure consistency, so that all generated projects follow the same standards and work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are updated THEN the system SHALL validate that all frontend templates use consistent configurations
2. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL check for Vercel compatibility
3. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL verify local development setup works
4. IF inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL report specific differences
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm all templates are deployment-ready
6. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent template updates until issues are resolved

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project generator user, I want confidence that generated projects use secure and maintained versions, so that my projects don't start with vulnerable dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking versions THEN the system SHALL verify they are not flagged with known security vulnerabilities
2. WHEN versions have security issues THEN the system SHALL use the latest secure version instead
3. WHEN generating projects THEN the system SHALL include security scanning configuration
4. IF security vulnerabilities are detected in current versions THEN the system SHALL alert maintainers
5. WHEN security updates are available THEN they SHALL be prioritized over feature updates
