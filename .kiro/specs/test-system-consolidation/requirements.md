# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on consolidating the test system for the Open Source Template Generator Go project to use a unified `go test -v ./...` command for both local development and CI/CD pipelines. Currently, the project maintains two separate test modes (`make test` and `make test-ci`) with different build tags and exclusions, which creates complexity and maintenance overhead. The consolidation will eliminate the need for build tags and CI-specific exclusions by fixing underlying test issues rather than bypassing them.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Reliability Consolidation

**User Story:** As a developer running tests locally or in CI, I want all tests to be reliable and fast enough to run with `go test -v ./...` in both environments, so that I don't need to remember different commands for different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `go test -v ./...` locally THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently without flaky behavior
2. WHEN running `go test -v ./...` in CI THEN all tests SHALL complete within 10 minutes maximum
3. WHEN any test fails THEN it SHALL fail for legitimate functional issues, not environmental or dependency problems
4. WHEN tests are resource-intensive THEN they SHALL be optimized or restructured to be CI-friendly
5. IF tests require external dependencies THEN those dependencies SHALL be mocked or provided through test setup
6. WHEN test consolidation is complete THEN the need for `-tags=ci` build flags SHALL be eliminated

### Requirement 2: Build Tag Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the test system, I want to remove all build tags and conditional test exclusions, so that the test suite is simpler and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test files THEN there SHALL be no `//go:build !ci` directives in any test files
2. WHEN running tests THEN no `-tags=ci` flags SHALL be required for any test execution
3. WHEN removing build tags THEN previously excluded tests SHALL be fixed to run reliably in CI
4. WHEN updating test files THEN all tests SHALL be unconditionally included in test runs
5. IF tests were excluded for good reasons THEN those underlying issues SHALL be resolved
6. WHEN build tag removal is complete THEN test execution SHALL be consistent across all environments

### Requirement 3: CI-Problematic Test Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer running tests in CI, I want previously problematic tests to be fixed rather than excluded, so that CI provides comprehensive test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining security validation tests THEN they SHALL be optimized to avoid false positives in CI
2. WHEN running template compilation tests THEN external dependencies SHALL be properly mocked or containerized
3. WHEN executing integration tests THEN they SHALL complete within reasonable timeouts
4. WHEN running resource-intensive tests THEN they SHALL be optimized for CI resource constraints
5. IF tests require specific setup THEN that setup SHALL be automated and reliable
6. WHEN problematic tests are fixed THEN they SHALL pass consistently in both local and CI environments

### Requirement 4: Makefile Test Target Unification

**User Story:** As a developer using the build system, I want unified test targets that use the same underlying command, so that build scripts are simpler and more predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `make test` THEN it SHALL execute `go test -v ./...` without any special flags
2. WHEN running `make test-ci` THEN it SHALL execute the same command as `make test`
3. WHEN using test targets THEN both SHALL provide identical test coverage and behavior
4. WHEN examining Makefile THEN test-related targets SHALL be simplified and consolidated
5. IF coverage targets exist THEN they SHALL use the same base test command with coverage flags
6. WHEN Makefile is updated THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained for existing scripts

### Requirement 5: Test Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer running tests frequently, I want tests to complete quickly without sacrificing coverage, so that development workflow is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running full test suite THEN execution time SHALL be under 10 minutes on standard CI hardware
2. WHEN optimizing tests THEN coverage SHALL not be significantly reduced (maintain >85% coverage)
3. WHEN tests are slow THEN they SHALL be profiled and optimized for performance
4. WHEN running tests in parallel THEN there SHALL be no race conditions or conflicts
5. IF tests are inherently slow THEN they SHALL be restructured into smaller, focused unit tests
6. WHEN performance optimization is complete THEN test feedback loop SHALL be significantly improved

### Requirement 6: Test Environment Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer setting up CI or running tests locally, I want consistent test environment requirements, so that tests behave identically across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests require specific configuration THEN that configuration SHALL be standardized and documented
2. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL not depend on external services unless properly mocked
3. WHEN test environment is set up THEN it SHALL be identical between local and CI environments
4. WHEN tests need temporary files THEN they SHALL properly clean up after themselves
5. IF tests require environment variables THEN they SHALL have sensible defaults or be mocked
6. WHEN environment standardization is complete THEN test results SHALL be deterministic

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Script Updates

**User Story:** As a developer reading project documentation, I want updated documentation that reflects the simplified test system, so that I understand how to run tests correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining CI_TESTING.md THEN it SHALL reflect the unified test approach
2. WHEN reading documentation THEN references to `-tags=ci` SHALL be removed or updated
3. WHEN checking CI configuration examples THEN they SHALL use the unified test command
4. WHEN reviewing scripts THEN ci-test.sh SHALL be updated or removed as appropriate
5. IF build tags are mentioned THEN those references SHALL be updated to reflect the new system
6. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL clearly explain the simplified test execution

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a developer with existing CI pipelines, I want the test system changes to be backward compatible where possible, so that existing workflows continue to function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing CI pipelines run `make test-ci` THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN legacy scripts use build tags THEN they SHALL either work or provide clear migration guidance
3. WHEN updating the system THEN breaking changes SHALL be clearly documented
4. WHEN migration is needed THEN clear upgrade instructions SHALL be provided
5. IF existing workflows depend on specific behavior THEN alternatives SHALL be documented
6. WHEN backward compatibility is implemented THEN it SHALL have a clear deprecation timeline
